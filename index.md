*Chemical ecology · insect olfaction · art–science*

---

I study the chemical ecology of plant–insect–microbe interactions, with a focus on
volatile-mediated communication and its applications in pest management.

My interest lies in making the unseen perceptible — exploring how transient chemical
signals can be mapped, visualized, and re-imagined through both scientific and artistic practices.
