## Anna Erdei
I study the chemical ecology of plant–insect–microbe interactions, with a focus on volatile-mediated communication and its applications in pest management.  
My interest lies in making the unseen perceptible—exploring how transient chemical signals can be mapped, visualized, and re-imagined through both scientific and artistic practices.
