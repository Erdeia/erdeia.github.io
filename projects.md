    <h2>Ongoing research projects</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), where I study the olfactory signals shaping the behavior of the codling moth, a major
      pest in apple production. My work focuses on how plant- and insect-derived volatiles influence host choice and mating, with the goal of improving semiochemical based pest-management
      strategies. In parallel, we have shown that attraction to the sex pheromone depends strongly on the surrounding host-volatile background, with implications for trap placement and the
      design of more behaviorally informed orchard systems. In parallel, I am investigating the role of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) and CHC-derived pheromones in species recognition and
      larval behavior. Beyond agriculture, I also explore applied chemical ecology in broader contexts, including the volatile markers for foodborne pathogens.

    <h2>Previous research projects</h2>

   <p> 
     I am a biologist specializing in photobiology and chemical ecology, with experience in agroindustry. My work links fundamental plant–insect research to sustainable food production, with
     an emphasis on how ecological mechanisms can be translated into pest-management practice. 
     I worked at the Plant Protection Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in close collaboration with farmers, focusing on the chemical communication of emerging and invasive
     pests.   This included identifying the sex pheromone of <em>Duponchelia fovealis</em> (Molnár et al. 2018) to support monitoring and mating disruption, and demonstrating that essential
     oils can  deter oviposition in the box tree moth (<em>Cydalima perspectalis</em>), a major threat to cultural landscapes where pesticide use is restricted (Szelényi, Erdei et al. 2020).
     Responding to acute agricultural problems, we also explored yeast-based live baits for selective monitoring of spotted-wing drosophila (Erdei et al. 2022). When walnut husk fly
     <em>Ragoletis completa</em> began causing serious yield losses in Hungary, we explored quince as a dead-end host, confirmed its preference over walnut, and identified key quince
     volatiles guiding host choice—work that can potentially informs orchard design and trap development to mitigate walnut damage (Kecskeméti et al. 2025).
     I later joined the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), where I studied the maize–Desmodium push–pull intercropping system, often cited as a textbook example of
     sustainable pest control. Rather than confirming the prevailing view that Desmodium repels moths, our results showed that it is preferred for larval feeding and may function mainly as a
     physical barrier to dispersal (Erdei et al. 2024). This reframing helps explain why efforts to adapt push–pull systems to other crops have frequently failed and highlights the 
     importance of understanding underlying mechanisms of intercropping strategies.

    <h2>Artistic interests</h2>

  <p>
    In addition to science, I have a long-standing interest in visual art, particularly the diversity of organic forms and how mutation and functional variation are inherent in diversity
    and adaptation. While studying olfaction in my chemical ecology research, I developed an interest in multisensory art and how to communicate olfactory processes beyond the walls of the
    laboratory. A key focus of my current outreach work is translating non-human modes of chemical communication into humanly perceivable and engaging forms. This allows non-human
    smellscapes to be shared not only as data, but also as lived and sensed experiences, encouraging more empathetic engagement with non-human perception.
