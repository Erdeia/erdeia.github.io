    <h2>Ongoing research projects</h2>
    <p>
      My current research focuses on the identification of behaviour-modifying chemicals
      and the associated olfactory receptors (ORs) that encode host specificity in the
      codling moth, <em>Cydia pomonella</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To address these questions, I combine chemical, sensory, and physiological approaches,
      including GC–SSR, GC–MS, GC–EAD, and HRMS.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a postdoctoral researcher, I work with Marie Bengtsson and Peter Witzgall.
      This project is funded by Formas (2021–2025).

    <h2>Previous research projects</h2>

   <p>
      During my PhD, I investigated the biosynthesis and degradation of chlorophyll
      precursors using fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy.
    </p>

  <p>
      My work later expanded to plant–herbivore–microbiome interactions and volatile cues
      mediating insect behaviour, including studies on <em>Drosophila suzukii</em>.
    </p>

  <p>
      I have also contributed to research on invasive and emerging pests, including:
    </p>

  <ul>
      <li>sex pheromone identification of <em>Duponchelia fovealis</em></li>
      <li>repellents against <em>Cydalima perspectalis</em></li>
      <li>repellents against <em>Lycoriella ingenua</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Interdisciplinary / artistic projects</h2>

  <p>
      Chemical cues form the primary language of plants and insects, yet remain largely
      absent from human sensory culture.
    </p>

  <p>
      Through chemical ecology and olfactory art, I explore how insect smellscapes can be
      translated into embodied, affective experiences that open access to non-human worlds.
