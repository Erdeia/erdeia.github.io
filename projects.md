## Ongoing research projects

My current research focuses on the identification of behaviour-modifying chemicals and the associated olfactory receptors (ORs) that encode host specificity in the codling moth, <em>Cydia pomonella</em>. I investigate how specific volatile cues are detected and translated into behavioural decisions relevant for mate finding and host location.

To address these questions, I combine chemical, sensory, and physiological approaches, including gas chromatography coupled to single sensillum recording (GC–SSR), gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS), antennal electrophysiology (GC–EAD), and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). These methods allow the identification of novel ligands of codling moth odorant receptors and the characterization of their ecological relevance.

As a postdoctoral researcher, I work under the guidance of Marie Bengtsson and Peter Witzgall. This project is funded by Formas (2021–2025).

## Previous research projects

During my PhD, I investigated the biosynthesis and degradation of chlorophyll precursors using fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy, with a focus on photochemical and developmental regulation.

Over time, my research interests expanded toward plant–herbivore–microbiome interactions and the volatile cues mediating these interactions. At the Plant Protection Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, I studied olfactory and behavioural differences between seasonal morphs of <em>Drosophila suzukii</em>, linking chemical cues to insect behavioural plasticity. As a visiting researcher in the Department of Plant Protection Biology, I investigated the field control of Drosophila suzukii using yeast-based lures in attract-and-kill systems. I also collaborated with Teun Dekker on elucidating the mechanisms underlying pest suppression in the Desmodium–maize push–pull intercropping system.
I have also contributed to several research projects on invasive and emerging pest species, including:
- identification of the sex pheromone of <em>Duponchelia fovealis</em>,
- identification of oviposition deterrents and repellents against the boxwood moth <em>Cydalima perspectalis</em>,
- identification of repellents against the fungus gnat <em>Lycoriella ingenua</em>.

## Interdisciplinary / artistic projects

Chemical cues form the primary language of plants and insects, yet remain largely absent from human sensory culture. Through my work in chemical ecology and engagement with olfactory art, I explore how insect smellscapes can be translated into embodied, affective experiences.

By combining scientific methods for analysing volatile-mediated interactions with artistic practices, I investigate how transient chemical signals can be sensed, interpreted, and re-imagined beyond data and representation. These interdisciplinary practices open spaces for engaging with non-human worlds and ecological processes through perception, experience, and material experimentation.
