        Over two decades ago, an intercropping strategy was developed that received critical acclaim for synergizing food security with ecosystem resilience in smallholder farming. The push–pull strategy reportedly suppresses lepidopteran pests in maize through a combination of a repellent intercrop (push), commonly <em>Desmodium</em> spp., and an attractive, border crop (pull). Key in the system is the intercrop’s constitutive release of volatile terpenoids that repel herbivores. However, the earlier described volatile terpenoids were not detectable in the headspace of <em>Desmodium</em>, and only minimally upon herbivory. This was independent of soil type, microbiome composition, and whether collections were made in the laboratory or in the field. Furthermore, in oviposition choice tests in a wind tunnel, maize with or without an odor background of <em>Desmodium</em> was equally attractive for the invasive pest <em>Spodoptera frugiperda</em>. In search of an alternative mechanism, we found that neonate larvae strongly preferred <em>Desmodium</em> over maize. However, their development stagnated and no larva survived. In addition, older larvae were frequently seen impaled and immobilized by the dense network of silica-fortified, non-glandular trichomes. Thus, our data suggest that <em>Desmodium</em> may act through intercepting and decimating dispersing larval offspring rather than adult deterrence. As a hallmark of sustainable pest control, maize–<em>Desmodium</em> push–pull intercropping has inspired countless efforts to emulate stimulo-deterrent diversion in other cropping systems. However, detailed knowledge of the actual mechanisms is required to rationally improve the strategy, and translate the concept to other cropping systems.

      <p>
Phortica variegata exhibits sexual dimorphism in olfactory responsivity, with males showing greater responsiveness to volatiles associated with host-seeking in other zoophilic dipterans, potentially guiding them to mammalian hosts for tear-feeding. Compared to D. melanogaster, P. variegata is more responsive to microbial and yeast-related volatiles and less responsive to plant-derived terpenoids, suggesting a foraging ecology linked to microbial substrates. The antennally detected volatiles identified in this study can be used as candidates for further behavioral studies to develop lures for vector management.
