## Supervision and mentoring

### PhD students and postdoctoral fellows
I have not yet held a formal appointment as a PhD co-supervisor; however, I am practically supervising several PhD students within my department, as well as students in other departments, whose projects involve GC–MS analysis and data evaluation. My supervision focuses on experimental design, analytical workflows, and interpretation of chemical ecology data.

### MSc and BSc students
- Supervision of MSc and BSc students (2024–2025): 2 students
